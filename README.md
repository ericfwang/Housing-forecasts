# Housing-forecasts
(R: forecast, zoo, and dplyr) Forecast house sales in New York using data from Zillow and the Federal Reserve. Uses a two-step ARIMA model that accounts for economic cycles. The forecast's accuracy was 93%. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos's *Forecasting: Principles and Practice*, 2nd edition (2018) was my academic reference.
