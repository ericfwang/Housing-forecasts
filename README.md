# Housing-forecasts
(R: forecast, zoo, and dplyr) Forecast the housing market in New York using data from Zillow and the Federal Reserve. Uses a two-step, dynamic ARIMA model that accounts for economic cycles and incorporates macroeconomic indicators. The forecast's accuracy was 93%. I used Hyndman and Athanasopoulos'sÂ *Forecasting: Principles and Practice*, 2nd edition (2018) as my academic reference.
